* Download the Extension folder, and rename it to something more distinguishable if you wish.
* In your Chromium broswer, navigate to Settings->Extensions and ensure that Developer Mode is enabled
* While still on the Extensions window, click "Load unpacked extension" and select the folder you have downloaded containing the Password Gym extension.
